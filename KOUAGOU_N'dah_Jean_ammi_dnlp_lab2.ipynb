        "3.    **Engaging** - To encourage users to talk to the bot, the bot should be able to generate interesting, engaging responses. If the only response was \"wow, that's cool,\" users are quite unlikely to want to talk very much to the chat bot\n",

Imagine we a model trained on a dataset talking about Coronavirus 2 or 3 years ago.
